Excution:

2) From the downloaded main folder, the command line must be opened. This can be done by typing cmd in the path-navigator 
3) In the command line you execute "npm pack", to generate a *.tgz file.
4) To install the created *.tgz-file, you can run 'npm install [Path to *.tgz-file]'
5) The library can now be used by adding "import {setContainer,open,play,pause,seek,stop,destroy} from 'nex-player-challenge';" at the beginning of your typescript file

Update 11:01.2021:
The functions have been created. They are currently without function. This status quo solely is supposed to make sure the library can be installed and the functions can correctly be called
